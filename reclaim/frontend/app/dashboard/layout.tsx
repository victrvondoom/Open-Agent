// unmounted and remounted the WebGL canvas (new context, new shader
// compile, new particle buffers) on every single navigation between
// dashboard pages -- that's what made clicking a nav link feel stuck.
// A shared layout keeps AppShell mounted across navigations; only the
// page content underneath swaps.
